## Full Stack Software Engineer 

I am a Backend Developer specializing in robust, secure, and scalable systems. With experience across multiple technology stacks, I focus on building high-performance applications that efficiently utilize available resources.

## Work Experience

**Mindsprint, Chennai, India**  
**Junior Engineer** (Jun 2024 - Present)
* Working exclusively with AWS cloud infrastructure and IaC tools to architect robust solutions for microservices and data-intensive applications
* Implementing migration strategies using AWS MGN for enterprise workloads
* Contributing to application development with ASP.NET Core and React for client-facing projects
* Learned: Advanced AWS resource optimization, IaC best practices, efficient cloud migration strategies


## Projects 

**TmuxCraft** (Creator and Maintainer)
* Built a Go-based alternative to tmuxifier with enhanced session templating and YAML configuration
* Implemented cross-platform support for Linux, macOS (Intel/ARM), and Windows
* Learning: Go system programming, CLI application architecture, cross-platform development challenges

**Wildfly Elytron** [wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron]
* Contributed to security framework improvements
* Learning: Enterprise security patterns, authentication protocols, JBoss architecture

**Crowdin SDKs** [crowdin-api-client-ruby & crowdin-api-client-java]
* Enhanced localization API clients for multiple language ecosystems
* Learning: API client design patterns, multi-language library maintenance

**Java Design Patterns** [iluwatar/java-design-patterns]
* Contributed pattern implementations and documentation
* Learning: Advanced OOP principles, design pattern application, code quality standards

## Professional Philosophy

I believe in building systems that maximize scalability and efficiency with minimal resources. My approach focuses on:

* **Resource Optimization**: Designing systems that perform efficiently under constrained environments
* **Scalable Architecture**: Implementing patterns that allow for horizontal growth without refactoring
* **Performance-First Mindset**: Identifying and eliminating bottlenecks before they impact users
* **Pragmatic Solutions**: Balancing architectural purity with practical implementation constraints

Throughout my projects, I've demonstrated this philosophy by implementing bit-manipulation techniques for storage optimization (achieving 98% reduction), designing modular systems with clear boundaries, and creating efficient data processing pipelines that minimize resource consumption.
